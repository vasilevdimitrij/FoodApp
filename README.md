## Reflection

  - This project is for a school exam.
 


At the end of the day, the technology implemented in this project is React. React is a JavaScript library for web and native user interfaces. This markup syntax is called JSX. It is a JavaScript syntax extension popularized by React. Putting JSX markup close to related rendering logic makes React components easy to create, maintain, and delete. Basically what React syntax enables is that the developer can write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code in one file.
